# Stacks Walkthrough
For this walkthrough we will look at the steps for implementing the Make Reservation feature
of Slalom Rentals.

### Part 1: Design
Here we will use the business reqiurements from the Slalom Rentals case
study to create developer specifications using use cases
and service contracts.  

### Part 2: Development
This is the biggest piece in this walkthrough.  Here we will take the use cases
and service contracts to:
1. Stub out methods and tests
2. Use the document tool to validate against specifications
3. Implement required functionality and tests
4. Check test reports and create additional reports

### Part 3: Deployment
Here we will deploy our service to an Azure API app and hit endpoints
using Postman.

### Part 4: Monitoring
In the monitor section, we will configure monitoring based on the business 
requirements and specifications - specificaly for performance and goal KPIs.
