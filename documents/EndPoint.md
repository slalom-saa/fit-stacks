# Endpoint

An endpoint is a well defined unit of solution logic that is intended to be executed by:
1. An external client
2. An internal, but remote service
3. Another in-memory endpoint

## Creating an Endpoint
Getting to the point of implementing the endpoint, you should be provided with a 
service contract.
