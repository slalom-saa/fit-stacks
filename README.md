# Slalom Stacks

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/6nb0ud2cpm4rkuyx/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/slalom-saa/stacks/branch/master)   [![NuGet Version](http://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Slalom.Stacks.svg?style=flat)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Slalom.Stacks/)

Stacks is truly portable.  Use the same code and host with 
ASP.NET Core, Nancy FX, Akka.NET, etc.  Plug in different common databases
such as SQL and MongoDB.  Open source code allows for you to add
extensions for however you want to use it.

Stacks is easily learned.  Framework simplicity and availability of training resources
removes the technology challenges and allows developers to worry about the
what instead of the how.  

Stacks facilitates a proven design and validation process. Service contracts
are reflected in code and are validated with built-in code analysis, test reports
and living documentation.
